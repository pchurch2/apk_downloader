**Checks before report**
- check [latest unstable build](https://bintray.com/skylot/jadx/unstable/_latestVersion#files) (maybe issue already fixed)
- check [Troubleshooting Q&A](https://github.com/skylot/jadx/wiki/Troubleshooting-Q&A) section on wiki
- search existing issues by exception message

**Describe error**
- provide full name of method or class with error
- provide full java stacktrace

  **Note**: no need to copy method fallback code (commented pseudocode)
- attach or provide link to apk file (double check apk version)

  **Note**: GitHub don't allow attach files with `.apk` extension, but you can change extension by adding `.zip` at the end :)
